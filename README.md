This program was written for the Shopify 2022 Summer Intern Coding Challenge
Mainly written using javascript, SpaceShare is a unique take on the requirements
Some notable features:
    The UI provides the ability to click through images with ease, operating on a cycle
    The program also allows the ability to like or dislike an image, or no comment, which remains for the rest of the open session
    The program uses an asset pack to store an animation of a loading icon, as well as a custom logo for the webpage as well
    If the user clicks on the image, the source link will be copied to their clipboard to be shared with friends
