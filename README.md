This program was written for the Shopify 2022 Summer Intern Coding Challenge

Mainly written using JavaScript, SpaceShare is a unique take on the requirements. It is a simple interface that allows the user to click through different images from the NASA Astronomy Photo of the Day. As well, the user can then like and dislike images as they cycle through. The image can even be shared by link by clicking on the image itself.

Some notable features:
    The UI provides the ability to click through images with ease, operating on a cycle
    The program also allows the ability to like or dislike an image, or no comment, which remains for the rest of the open session
    The program uses an asset pack to store an animation of a loading icon, as well as a custom logo for the webpage as well
    If the user clicks on the image, the source link will be copied to their clipboard to be shared with friends
    The webpage is connected through a subdomain of my personal .tech domain

TODO for the future:
    Save likes on a database for the user
    Add a download button for the image
    Make more mobile friendly
